# Graffiti detection using YOLOv4
This project performs a performance comparison of an object-detection application for detecting illegal graffiti on walls using Darknet's YOLOv4 implementation for two sets of images. The first one is the original set of images of illegal graffiti and the second is the same images pre-processed using high-boost to enhance the high-frequencie areas of the image, such as the graffitis it is trying to detect.
