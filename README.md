# Graffiti detection using YOLOv4

On this project I make an object-detection application for detecting illegal graffiti on walls using Darknet's YOLOv4 implementation. I use this implementation to make a performance comparison of this algorithm results on two sets of images. The first set is composed of images of illegal graffiti obtained from Google Images, and the second composes of those same images pre-processed using unsharp-mask to enhance the high frequency areas of the image.

A detailed description of the methodology used on the creation of the datasets and the implementation of the detection algorith is presented at the article on file "IllegalGraffitiDetectionUsingYOLOv4.pdf".

Code is implemented on a Google Colab notebook, available on this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RoG9njaAtb6JEASSPcqFqKPdXja9tpx0?usp=sharing).
